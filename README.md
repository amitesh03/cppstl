# CPP STL Repository

This repository is dedicated to understanding and practicing the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) containers, algorithms, iterators, and more.

## Introduction

The C++ STL is a powerful library that provides a collection of container classes, algorithms, and iterators. It offers a wide range of functionality, making it easier to write efficient and maintainable code.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to serve as a learning resource for anyone interested in mastering the CPP STL. It provides examples, explanations, and exercises to help you gain a deeper understanding of the library.

## Contents

The repository is organized into the following sections:

1. Containers: Explore various container classes such as vectors, lists, maps, and more.
2. Algorithms: Learn about the different algorithms available in the STL, including sorting, searching, and manipulating elements.
3. Iterators: Understand the concept of iterators and how they can be used to traverse and manipulate elements in containers.
4. Examples: Find practical examples that demonstrate the usage of different STL components in real-world scenarios.
5. Exercises: Test your knowledge and skills with a set of exercises designed to reinforce your understanding of the CPP STL.
